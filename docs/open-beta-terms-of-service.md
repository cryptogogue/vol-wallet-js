### Volition Open Beta Terms of Service

This Terms of Service covers participation in the Volition CCG Open Beta and any permitted use of the Volition blockchain, Volition CCG and VOLWAL (the Volition wallet).

Cryptogogue, Inc. is offering early access to an incomplete version of Volition CCG to the general public as part of an Open Beta. Cryptogogue, Inc. may end this Open Beta with or without notice and for any or no reason at any time of its choosing.

As an Open Beta user, you may obtain non-fungible cryptographic assets ("Assets") and units of a cryptocurrency ("VOL"). You may exchange Assets and VOL with other Open Beta users.

**You agree to not sell or exchange any Assets or VOL for fiat currency (i.e. money) or any other cryptocurrency, or to solicit any holder of Assets or VOL to do so.**

You acknowledge that Assets and VOL are provided for entertainment purposes only and have no monetary value.

During Open Beta, you may print or cause to be printed physical copies of any Assets associated with your account for your own personal use.

Assets and VOL obtained during Open Beta may not carry over into any future deployment of Volition and may no longer be accessible or useable following the end of Open Beta.

You agree to not represent to any third party that the Assets and VOL issued under Open Beta will ever have any monetary value or will ever be redeemable for any other kind of asset.

You understand and agree that your Assets and VOL will cease to exist when Open Beta ends and that no equivalent (or any) Assets of VOL will be granted to you under any future deployment of Volition.

You acknowledge that Cryptogogue, Inc. is under no obligation to any Open Beta user for anything and agree to hold Cryptogogue, Inc. and its agents harmless from any damages arising from use of its software or your participation in Open Beta.

Cryptogogue, Inc. does not actively collect or store any of your personally identifying information, *however* you understand and acknowledge that any transactions you send to the Volition mining network may be stored indefinitely in a distributed ledger, publicly accessible to anyone. Do not send any transactions contining information that you expect to remain private.
